# RRFS_plot_python

**This repository contains various Python scripts for producing graphics of Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS) grib2 output at NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC).  A description of each script is provided below.**

<ins>plot_allvars_3panel.py</ins>: Generates 3-panel plots comparing output from two models and their differences for ~70 unique fields.

<ins>plot_allvars_4panel.py</ins>: Generates 4-panel plots comparing output from four models for ~70 unique fields.

<ins>plot_cloudcover.py</ins>: Generates 2-panel plots comparing the low/mid/high cloud cover from two models.

<ins>plot_ptype.py</ins>: Generates 2-panel plots comparing the precipitation type from two models.

<ins>plot_rrfs_1member.py</ins>: Generates plots of a single RRFS ensemble member for 2-m temperature, 2-m dew point temperature, composite reflectivity, max/min hourly 2-5 km updraft helicity, most unstable CAPE/CIN, max hourly upward vertical velocity, total precipitation, percent of frozen precipitation, snow depth, 6-hr change in snow depth, precipitation rate, frozen precipitation rate, snowfall (10:1 SLR), and 1-hr accumulated snowfall (10:1 SLR).

<ins>plot_rrfs_9members.py</ins>: Generates postage stamp plots of an RRFS 9-member ensemble for 2-m temperature, 2-m dew point temperature, composite reflectivity, max/min hourly 2-5 km updraft helicity, most unstable CAPE/CIN, max hourly upward vertical velocity, and total precipitation.

<ins>plot_uhtracks_9members.py</ins>: Generates postage stamp plots of an RRFS 9-member ensemble for run-total max hourly 2-5 km updraft helicity tracks.
